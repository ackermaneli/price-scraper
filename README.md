# Products Scraper & Price Comparison

This project is a **web scraping tool** that extracts product prices from two websites and compares them.  
It is designed to scrape data from **The Reject Shop** and **Woolworths**, matching products by name and reporting the price difference.

---

## Features

- **Phase 1:** Scrapes product details (SKU, name, and price) from **The Reject Shop**.
- **Phase 2:** Searches for the same product on **Woolworths** and compares prices.
- Saves results in **JSON format**.
- Handles **anti-scraping measures** like **randomized user agents**, **retry and reconnect mechanism**, and **delays**.
- Uses **OOP principles** for modular and reusable code.

## Setup & Installation

### **🔹 Prerequisites**
- Python **3.11** (recommended)
- **pip** or **micromamba** for managing dependencies
- **Google Chrome** or **Firefox** (for Playwright)
- **Note:** You may encounter **HTTP2 errors** using Chrome.  
  One way to handle it is by adding this argument:  
  ```python
  args=['--disable-http2']
  ```
  in the **Playwright `goto` function**.

---

### **🔹 Install Dependencies**

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or if using **micromamba**:

```sh
micromamba install --file requirements.txt
```

---

### **🔹 Install Playwright Browsers**

```sh
playwright install
```

---

## Usage

### **Step 1: Add SKUs to `skus.txt`**
Add a list of SKUs (one per line) that you want to scrape from **The Reject Shop**.

Example:
```
30061292
30113527
30115549
```

---

### **Step 2: Run the Scraper**
```sh
python scraper.py
```
The script will:
1. Scrape each SKU from **The Reject Shop**.
2. Search for a matching product on **Woolworths**.
3. Save results in **JSON files**.

---

## Example Output

### **🔹 Phase 1 (`phase1_results.json`)**
```json
[
    {
        "SKU": "30061292",
        "Product Name": "Palmolive Shampoo Intensive Coconut Cream 350mL",
        "Price": "$3.75",
        "Date": "2025-03-12"
    }
]
```

### **🔹 Phase 2 (`phase2_results.json`)**
```json
[
    {
        "SKU": "30061292",
        "Product Name The Reject Shop": "Palmolive Shampoo Intensive Coconut Cream 350mL",
        "Price_RejectShop": "$3.75",
        "Product Name Woolworths": "Palmolive Shampoo Naturals Intensive Moisture 350ml",
        "Price_Woolworths": "$3.00",
        "Price Difference": "$0.75",
        "Date": "2025-03-12"
    }
]
```

## **How It Works**  

### **🔹 Scraper Architecture**
- **`BaseScraper`** (Parent class):  
  Handles **Playwright setup**, **fetching pages**, and **user agents**.
- **`RejectShopScraper`**:  
  Scrapes product details from **The Reject Shop**.
- **`WoolworthsScraper`**:  
  Searches for the product on **Woolworths** and extracts price.

### **🔹 Data Extraction & Matching**  
#### **Scraping The Reject Shop**
- We fetch the **product page** for each SKU and extract:
  - **Product Name**, **Price**, and **SKU** using **BeautifulSoup**.
- The data is **saved in JSON format**.

#### **Searching on Woolworths**
- Woolworths **does not** provide direct links by SKU, so we **search by product name** instead.
- The search results contain **multiple product tiles**.

#### **Extracting Woolworths Data (Playwright)**
- We use **Playwright locators** to extract product **name, price, and URL** from `wc-product-tile` elements.

#### **Fuzzy Matching for Accurate Comparison**
- Since product names differ across websites, we use **RapidFuzz** to find the **best match** using WRatio algorithm.

#### **Saving & Comparing Prices**
- The final output includes:
  - The **Reject Shop product details**.
  - The **best-matched Woolworths product**.
  - The **price difference**.
- Data is stored in **JSON format**.

### **🔹 Anti-Bot Measures**
- **Random User-Agent** rotation
- **Delays** between requests
- **Browser restarts** every few searches

## 📝 Notes
- This script is for **educational purposes**.
- Website structures may **change over time**, requiring updates.
- **Respect website terms of service** when scraping.
